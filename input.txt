With the coming of multicore processors and the cloud, parallel computing is most cer-
tainly not a niche area off in a corner of the computing world. Parallelism has become
central to the efficient use of resources, and this new textbook by Peter Pacheco will go a
long way toward introducing students early in their academic careers to both the art and
practice of parallel computing.
